# MEK6802D5 Puncher

The puncher program is used to retrieve data from the MEK6802D5's memory, either RAM or ROM.

## Installing Required Software
---

You will need to download and install the gcc compiler along with the tools that you'll need to run make. You can do this through either Cygwin or MinGW.  The choice is up to you as to which one you want to use.  Here are some links to get you started:
```
https://sourceware.org/cygwin/
http://www.mingw.org/
```
To me, this always seems to be a little bit of a struggle for there isn't one single application installer that seems to do everything that you need.  So it gets to be a little bit of a hunt-and-peck process, but stick with it and you'll eventually get things to work properly.

## Building the loader program
---

Once you can run make and have it call gcc, building the program is as simple as entering the following command:
```
$ cd <path>/mek6802d5-puncher
$ make all
gcc -I./include -c -o obj/mek6802d5-puncher.o src/mek6802d5-puncher.c
Compiled obj/mek6802d5-puncher.o successfully!
gcc -o  bin/mek6802d5-puncher obj/mek6802d5-puncher.o
Linking bin/mek6802d5-puncher complete!
```
