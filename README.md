# Binary loader for the Motorola MEK6802D5

This program is intended to be used to load an assembled program into the Motorola MEK6802D5 development board.  

What this program does is it simulates the audio signal coming from a cassette tape drive.  This provides the ability to write your assembly code in a standard text editor and use the Motorola 6800 assembler to generate your binary file that can then be loaded using this program.
